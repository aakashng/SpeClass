    %Creates a 5x5 confusion matrix (regardless of whether there is data
    %from all 5 classes) which is important for patients that don't have
    %stars activities. Function also calculates overall accuracy. codesTrue
    %and codesPredict are numeric vectors with integer values ranging ONLY
    %from 1 to 5.

    for t = 1:length(codesTrue)
